Goal: Create a web application that allows users to easily spin up and manage PostgreSQL Docker containers on a Virtual Private Server (VPS). The application should be simple to deploy and use, requiring minimal configuration from the user.

### Updated Project Plan: PostgreSQL Database Management Web App

#### Objective
Create a web application using Next.js (app router), TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and ShadCN that allows users to easily create, manage, and delete PostgreSQL Docker containers on a VPS. Each PostgreSQL container will host exactly one database, providing full isolation and simplicity.

#### High-Level Architecture

1. **Frontend**: Built with Next.js (using the app router feature) and styled with TailwindCSS and ShadCN for UI components.
2. **Backend**: API routes in Next.js to handle Docker interactions for container creation and management.
3. **Docker**: Utilized for creating, managing, and removing PostgreSQL containers, with each container containing a single PostgreSQL database.

---

### Features and Components

#### 1. Frontend (Next.js with App Router, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and ShadCN)
- **UI Components** (using ShadCN):
  - **Container Management Dashboard**:
    - Form to create a new PostgreSQL container with options for image version, username, password, and port.
    - List of running PostgreSQL containers, each representing a single database, with details (container name, status, connection URL).
    - Buttons to delete containers.
  - **Alerts and Notifications**: To inform users about the success or failure of operations (e.g., container creation, deletion).

#### 2. Backend (Next.js API Routes)
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/containers`: Create a new PostgreSQL container with a single database.
  - `GET /api/containers`: List all running PostgreSQL containers and their details.
  - `DELETE /api/containers/:id`: Stop and remove a specific PostgreSQL container.

- **Docker Interaction**:
  - Use Docker CLI commands or Docker SDK for Node.js (`dockerode`) within Next.js API routes to manage Docker containers.

#### 3. Docker
- **PostgreSQL Image**: Use the official PostgreSQL Docker image, allowing users to select different versions.
- **Docker Commands**:
  - `docker run`: To create and start new PostgreSQL containers.
  - `docker ps`: To list running containers.
  - `docker stop` and `docker rm`: To stop and remove containers.

### Updated API Design

1. **Create PostgreSQL Container with a Single Database**
   - **Endpoint**: `POST /api/containers`
   - **Request Body**:
     ```json
     {
       "name": "my_postgres",
       "version": "latest",
       "port": 5432,
       "username": "user",
       "password": "password"
     }
     ```
   - **Docker Actions**:
     - Pull the specified PostgreSQL image version.
     - Run a new Docker container with the specified settings.
   - **Response**:
     ```json
     {
       "id": "container_id",
       "name": "my_postgres",
       "url": "postgres://user:password@vps_ip:5432/dbname"
     }
     ```

2. **List Running Containers**
   - **Endpoint**: `GET /api/containers`
   - **Response**:
     ```json
     [
       {
         "id": "container_id",
         "name": "my_postgres",
         "status": "running",
         "url": "postgres://user:password@vps_ip:5432/dbname"
       }
     ]
     ```

3. **Remove PostgreSQL Container**
   - **Endpoint**: `DELETE /api/containers/:id`
   - **Docker Actions**:
     - Stop the specified container.
     - Remove the container.
   - **Response**:
     ```json
     {
       "message": "Container removed successfully."
     }
     ```

### Project Setup

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Ensure Node.js and Docker are installed and configured on the VPS.

3. **Deployment Instructions**:
   - **Clone the Repo**: `git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name.git`
   - **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` in the root directory.
   - **Start the Development Server**: Run `npm run dev` to start the Next.js development server.
   - **Build for Production**: Run `npm run build` and `npm start` to serve the production build.

### Considerations

1. **Security**: 
   - Implement authentication for the web interface to prevent unauthorized access.
   - Securely handle environment variables (e.g., database credentials, Docker socket path).
   - Ensure the Docker socket is not exposed publicly and is only accessible by the Next.js server.

2. **Error Handling and Validation**:
   - Implement robust error handling in API routes and UI components to manage Docker errors, validation errors, and edge cases (e.g., port conflicts, Docker daemon unavailability).

3. **Environment Variables**:
   - Use environment variables in Next.js to manage sensitive information and configuration settings (e.g., default PostgreSQL credentials, Docker socket path).

5. **User Experience**:
   - Use TailwindCSS and ShadCN to create an intuitive and responsive UI.
   - Provide clear feedback to the user for all actions (e.g., spinner during loading, success/failure notifications).

6. **Backup and Data Persistence**:
   - By default, Docker containers have ephemeral storage. Consider implementing a strategy for persistent data storage if required, using Docker volumes to ensure data is not lost when containers are removed.

By focusing on creating a new Docker container for each PostgreSQL database, this plan keeps the application simple and provides strong isolation between different databases. It ensures a straightforward user experience, where users can easily create and manage PostgreSQL instances without dealing with shared resources or complex configurations.
